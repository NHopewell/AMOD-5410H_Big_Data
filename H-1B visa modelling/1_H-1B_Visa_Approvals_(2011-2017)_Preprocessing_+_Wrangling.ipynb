    "**Overview:**\n",
    "The original source of these data comes from the US department of labour. H-1B visas are a category of employment-based, non-immigrant visas for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, a US employer must offer them a job and submit a petition for a H-1B visa to the US immigration department. This is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:**\n",
    "This dataset contains seven year's worth of H-1B petition data, with a little over 3.6 million records in total. The columns in the final dataset (after preprocessing and explpratory analysis) include case status, employer name, worksite coordinates, job title, prevailing wage, occupation code, and year filed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The fully cleaned and combined version of these data appeared partially on Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Kaggle data, the data wrangling and cleaning was done with R (mostly with dplyr) - this process will be replicated here with Python (see below): \n",
    "\n",
    "**The current work:** I will not use the cleaned and combined data but instead begin with the raw separate data files and do my own cleaning, wrangling, and analysis of the data with Python. I will also be using more recently available data in addition to that included on kaggle. My goal is to arrive at the same cleaned state as the data used on Kaggle by using Python and Pandas/Numpy for cleaning and wrangling instead of R and dplyr. I will also replicate some of this process with pyspark as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that I greatly improved the data wrangling process compared to the original process done in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised learning stage will also be done with both python ml libraries (scikit) and spark ml libraries (mllib). I may also do this phase with R and Caret as well as with sparklyr. The R component would not be included in this notebook but instead in an Rmarkdown file."

One can see that, after standardization, the 75th percentile remained mostly unchanged but the max value and SD were pulled way up due to the number of hourly outliers who were converted to yearly. "

    "To get a sense of how much this process of replacing missing data biased the distributions of prevailing wages split by full time position, it is important to look at the overlap between the 2016 box plots and those of the other years. Looking at the 2016 prevailing wage distribution for full-time positions (Blue), we can see that the 50th percentile (median) lies above the 75th of the wage distributions of all other years, excluding 2017. Although the distributions overlap, I believe this is a problem which is not easily solved here. Any solution would introduce equivalent bias in the non-full-time distribution. "
